LowWerks VW Suspension Website
Project Overview

In Part 1 of our website development, we corrected and expanded the initial design and content to better align with the project proposal. Additional information was added to provide a more complete and professional representation of the LowWerks VW Suspension brand. We included extra comments in the HTML and CSS code to help future developers understand the structure and styling choices.

We are also adding this README file to the project folder to explain the purpose, functionality, and design of each page in detail, as well as the resources we used throughout development. All the content mentioned in our initial proposal has been implemented, including product showcases, company story, FAQs, and contact information. The website aims to be a fully visual and functional guide for LowWerks VW Suspension, allowing customers to browse products, learn about the brand, and engage with the company professionally.

Pages Overview
1. Home Page (index.html)

The home page is the first impression for any visitor. It features:

Hero Section: Full-width banner with a dark-themed VW car image and glowing accents. Overlay text encourages users with the slogan: “Drop Your Ride. Elevate Your Style.” A prominent Shop Now button leads users to the catalog page.

Featured Products: A selection of 3–4 products displayed in card format with images, price, and a View Details button.

Why Choose Us: Icons with brief descriptions highlighting key differentiators: trusted VW fitment, high-quality parts, and contribution to the stance culture.

Customer Showcase: Grid layout featuring cars fitted with LowWerks parts to inspire confidence and engagement.

This page sets the tone of professionalism, style, and performance, reflecting the company’s brand identity while guiding users to other sections of the site.

2. Catalog Page (catalog.html)

The catalog page presents all available products in an organized, easy-to-browse format:

Category Sidebar: Users can filter products by Coilovers, Lowering Springs, Air Suspension, Wheels, and Steering Wheels.

Product Grid: Each category contains four product cards (image, name, price in red, and View Details button). Hovering over a card produces a red glowing outline to create a dynamic effect.

Multiple Sections: Coilovers, rims, springs, steering wheels, and air suspension are displayed as separate sections, each with 4 products. This improves navigation and encourages exploration.

This page ensures that users can quickly find the right product for their VW model and encourages deeper interaction with the site’s offerings.

3. Product Page (product.html)

The product page focuses on more information regarding the products we are selling:

Add to Cart Button: Visual-only for now, showing how the cart could work in future iterations.


4. Cart Page (cart.html)

The cart page allows users to review their selected items before checkout:

Cart Table: Dark-themed table showing product thumbnail, name, quantity, and price.

Summary Sidebar: Displays subtotal, shipping (static text), total in bold red, and a Proceed to Checkout button (visual only).

This page enhances user experience by providing an overview of purchases and encourages trust in the purchase process. Even though the cart is not yet functional, it demonstrates a professional e-commerce layout.

5. FAQs Page (faq.html)

The FAQ page answers common customer questions using an accordion style:

Accordion Layout: Each question expands to reveal the answer, with a smooth animation.

Dark Theme: Questions turn red on hover to maintain the site’s stylistic consistency.

Questions Include: Compatibility checks, shipping information, installation advice, and return policies.

This page reduces customer support inquiries, educates users, and enhances user trust by providing clear, easy-to-access answers.

6. About Page (about.html)

The About page tells the story of LowWerks VW Suspension:

Header Image: Workshop photo with dark overlay and white text: “Built by Enthusiasts, for Enthusiasts.”

Founder Story: Extended text detailing the founder’s journey, Polokwane roots, passion for VW, and company growth since 2024.

Mission: Describes the company’s goal to grow stance culture nationwide.

Founder Photo Placeholder: Greyscale image with red border glow for visual appeal.

This page strengthens the brand image, builds emotional connection with users, and communicates expertise and dedication.

7. Contact Page (contact.html)

The Contact page provides multiple ways for customers to reach LowWerks:

Contact Form: Fields for Name, Email, and Message, along with a Send Message button.

Social Links: WhatsApp button (green) and Instagram icon link, visually integrated into the dark theme.

Location: Polokwane, South Africa is mentioned for transparency and trust.

Map Embed: Optional Google Maps iframe showing Polokwane in dark mode.

This page makes it easy for customers to communicate with the company, helping to convert inquiries into sales and reinforcing professionalism.

7. Revies Page (reviews.html)

The Reviews page acts as a comprehensive knowledge base for all products listed within the LowWerks catalog. Each product is given its own dedicated review section, highlighting not only technical specifications but also the cultural significance of how it fits into the stance community. The design ensures that every section begins with a sticky title bar, so as users scroll, they always know which product review they are currently reading. The content in this page is deliberately word-heavy, creating a storytelling effect rather than just listing dry information. This page serves two main purposes: (1) to give potential buyers the confidence they need by seeing in-depth breakdowns of each item, and (2) to demonstrate the authenticity and authority of LowWerks in the automotive aftermarket industry. It ties the emotional side of the culture (why enthusiasts love the products) with the rational side (what the product does, how it performs, and its pricing context). In short, the Reviews page doesn’t just “sell”—it educates, persuades, and builds trust, which is crucial for long-term growth of the site.

Development Notes

The website uses HTML, CSS, and simple JavaScript for interactive elements such as the accordion FAQ.

A single styles.css file consolidates all styling across pages to maintain consistency in dark/red theme, hover effects, fonts, and layout.

Images, icons, and product placeholders can be easily updated by replacing [Img] or [Founder Photo] placeholders with real assets.

The website is designed to be visually appealing, user-friendly, and scalable, with future potential for functional e-commerce features.
